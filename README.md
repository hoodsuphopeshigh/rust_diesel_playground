# rust_diesel_playground

Playground to see what can be done with [diesel](https://diesel.rs/) and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)

A collection of small self-contained Rust applications that focus on the bare minimum needed to demonstrate a concept.

**Note:** Will need to install the `diesel_cli` with `cargo install diesel_cli`
